# Buy

Syntax: buy   \<number\> \<object\>  
Syntax: list  \<object\>  
Syntax: sell  \<object\>  
Syntax: value \<object\>  
Syntax: browse \<object\>  

BUY buys "number" objects from a shop keeper.  The number is optional.  
BROWSE allows you to view the object before you buy it.  

LIST with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.  
LIST \<object\> lists only the items corresponding with \<object\> the shop  
keeper will sell you.  

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.  

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.  

BUY, SELL, and VALUE, as well as most other object manipulation commands,  
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  
For example, if LIST DAGGER showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,  
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:  
"buy 3.dagger".
