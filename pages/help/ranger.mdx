# Ranger

Rangers walk with serenity around the wildness they call home. They are fighters, but they  
understand nature at a level the rest of us simply can't. Their at-one-ness with nature  
even allows them to call aid from it in battle. They, like the Druid, can walk among even  
the most aggressive foe without fear of attack. These and more are the powers you can posses  
if you chose to train as a Ranger.  

Rangers are battlemages and as such use both magic and melee in combat. Their melee may not  
ever match that of a Samurai, Paladin or Monk, and their magic will probably not match the  
Sorcerer, but the combination of skills allows the Ranger a freedom seldom enjoyed by mortal  
men.
