# Areas

Syntax: areas [\<min level\> \<max level\>]  
Syntax: commands  
Syntax: socials  

AREAS shows you all of the currently active areas in the game. Optionally you  
can add min and max level to the end to limit what is returned, i.e.  

AREAS 20 30  

Remember that the level is the average of all the mobs; you may find far larger  
and far small mobs in the areas. Always read the signs!  

COMMANDS shows you all of the commands (except socials) available to you.  

SOCIALS shows you all of the social commands available to you.
