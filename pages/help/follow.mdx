# Follow

Syntax: follow \<character\>  
Syntax: group  
Syntax: group \<character\>  
Syntax: ditch \<character\>  

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,  
just FOLLOW \<yourself\>.  

GROUP \<character\> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.  
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and  
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group attacks, you will automatically  
join the fight if you have AUTOASSIST turned on.  

If the \<character\> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will  
kick out the \<character\> from your group.  Characters can also leave your  
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.  

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.  

You may GROUP with characters who are within 50 levels of you, but the closer  
you get in levels, the better the xp will become. I.E 50 level gap lowers the xp for the  
whole group, to prevent crazy powerleveling.  

DITCH will make someone stop following you. Useful if you don't want a person  
to follow you. :P
