  Elves are slightly taller than humans, but are lighter built.  
They lack the strength and stamina of other races, but are far  
more agile.  Elves can see well in the dark, and rumors say  
they can even walk over water.  They also regenerate mana  
easier than other races.  That combined with their intelligence  
makes them really good magic users.
