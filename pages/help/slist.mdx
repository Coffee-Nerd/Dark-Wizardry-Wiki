# Slist

Syntax: slist  
Syntax: slist \<class\>  
Syntax: slist \<spell/skill\>  
Syntax: slist spells  

This command on its own shows you ALL the spells and skills available for  
your class.  

To show skills and spells for other classes, use SLIST \<class\> - i.e.  
SLIST WAR.  

If you provide the spell or skill, it will tell you for what class and on  
what level the skill/spell is available, i.e.  

SLIST SUMMON gives you the result:  

'summon' is available to the following classes:  
Cleric (Level 15).  
Psionic (Level 12).  

Finally, SLIST SPELLS just lists all the spells in the game.
