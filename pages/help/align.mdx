# Align

Alignment reflects your character's moral and ethical stance, ranging from  
-1000 (utterly evil) to +1000 (purely good).  

Neutral is centered around 0, with most characters drifting naturally  
toward balance over time if their actions don't push them in a specific  
direction.  

Every creature you defeat and choice you make influences your alignment.  
Good characters grow stronger by defeating evil foes, their alignment moving  
closer to +1000. Evil characters revel in malicious deeds, pulling themselves  
further into the darkness of -1000. Neutral characters, unbound by the extremes,  
often deal more consistent damage since they need not fear a mob's protection  
from good or evil spells.  

Alignment impacts how the world interacts with you. Some items, such as a  
Holy Sword of Light, require a high alignment to wield, while darker artifacts  
like the 238Dagger of Shadows demand a steep descent into evil. NPCs may also  
treat you differently based on your alignment. A righteous knight might refuse  
help to a villain, and an unscrupulous merchant may overcharge a noble paladin.  

202Your alignment also affects the experience you earn. Fighting enemies whose  
alignment is opposite to yours grants higher experience rewards. For example,  
virtuous characters gain more XP for defeating evil creatures, while evil  
characters gain more XP for slaying good ones. Neutral characters gain slightly  
reduced XP overall but enjoy the advantage of consistent damage output.  

Managing alignment requires careful attention to your actions. Slaying enemies  
with values far from your own causes significant shifts, while smaller  
misalignments result in subtler changes. If your alignment strays too far, you  
can slay opposite aligned foes or NPC services to help you realign your path.
