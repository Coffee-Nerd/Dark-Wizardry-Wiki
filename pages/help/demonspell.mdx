# Demonspell

Syntax: cast demon \<target\>  

This spell will summon a demon from hell, snatching the victim's body.  
This action instantly kills any mob on which the spell is cast, but in  
doing so, destroys any gold/equipment the mob may be carrying.  Should  
this spell be cast upon a player, there is no instant kill.  Instead,  
the target takes massive damage.  

There exist monsters within the world who even the demon can not take.  
For these the demon will damage your victim instead.
