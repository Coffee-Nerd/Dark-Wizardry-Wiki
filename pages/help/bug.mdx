# Bug

Syntax: bug report \<bug\>  
Syntax: idea \<idea\>  
Syntax: typo report \<typo\>  

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback to  
the mud implementors.  
If you find a bug or want your idea implemented faster, it helps to send a note  
to the imms as well.
