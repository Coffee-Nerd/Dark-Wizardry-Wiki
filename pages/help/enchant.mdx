# Enchant

Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' \<armor\>  

This spell magically enchants some armor, improving its armor class, and  
maybe even adding some extra stats! Pieces of armor can be enchanted up  
to 20 times each, but they have an increasing chance of exploding, due  
to being overloaded with magical enchantments.  

It is strongly recommended that you do not exceed 10 enchants without  
using NO-FAIL enchant tokens, which can be earned during events, or given  
out on special occasions.  

However, enchantments over 10 are much more powerful, and are highly  
sought after.... There is also a special chance for a SUPER enchant,  
which will increase the enchantment amount by 2.  

If your armor momentarily turns black, it is a good sign to stop enchanting.  
You have been warned!  
Happy enchanting!
