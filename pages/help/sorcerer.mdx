# Sorcerer

Sorcerers are the ultimate in the magical disciplines. Known for their unbelievably  
powerful magics, when you enroll to train as a Sorcerer you will be required to dedicate  
everything you can to your mental abilities at the cost of all else. Should you do so,  
you can expect to deal more damage than any other specialization - however clearly this  
comes at a cost, and that cost is your fragility.  

Sorcerers are completely useless in melee combat, meaning they won't do as much melee  
damage as other specializations.
