# Dexterity

Dexterity is the general "finesse" of your character's movements.  

Dexterity is directly linked to your base hit roll. Low dexterity may  
give you a negative hit roll, high dexterity will give you a bonus.  

Higher dexterity will give one better armor class (AC), thus allowing  
fewer swings to actually connect with your character.  

Dexterity is also linked with many thieve's and assassin's skills such  
as backstab, garotte and circle.
