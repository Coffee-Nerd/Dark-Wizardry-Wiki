# Divine

Syntax 'divine intervention'  

You can also just type "divine", but divine intervention  
is a skill that helps you recall in places where you may  
have no other possible option. This may happen if you are  
in a place that is norecall, and nomagic.. Usually you can use a map, or  
a warp stone, but if you don't have one, divine intervention  
is meant to be used as a last resort.  

This skill has a very long cooldown, and should be used sparingly.
