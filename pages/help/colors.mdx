# Colors

Color Codes in Dark Wizardry  

Syntax: color \<defaults|list|set|toggle\> \<field #\> \<color\>  
    defaults: Reset your colors to default.  
    list: Show current color settings.  
    toggle: Toggle colors ON or OFF.  
    set: Set your own color preferences.  

Basic Colors  

To use a basic color, use the $ symbol followed by a letter:  
$ : red             $ : light red  
$ : green           $ : light green  
$ : yellow          $ : light yellow  
$ : blue            $ : light blue  
$ : magenta         $ : light magenta  
$ : cyan            $ : light cyan  
$ : grey            $ : white  
$ : dark grey       $ : Random Color  

$$$$ : $iteral Dollar Sign  


An example would be like this.....  
I love the color $red, but I love the color $yellow even more!  
That would appear as follows:  
I love the color red, but I love the color yellow even more!  
xterm colors are slightly different. These require $123, where 123 is a set of 3 numbers.  
Here is a link to a color palette, which will help a lot!

For example, $208 is orange, 208like this.  

$238 238Would be quite dark, like this....  
You get the idea! Happy coloring!  

P.S. I have made a VERY cool COLORIZER tool. All you do is type,  
and you can easily select color gradients you want... then BAM!
