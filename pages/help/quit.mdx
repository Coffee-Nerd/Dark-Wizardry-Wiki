# Quit

Syntax: quit  
Syntax: save  
Syntax: suicide  

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to  
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you  
save or not.  

Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.  

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT only at temples or safe rooms.  
When you re-enter the game you will be back in the room you quit before.  

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one  
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into  
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that  
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.  

SUICIDE also makes you leave the game, but deletes your character too.  So  
there's NO way to get back.  First type SUICIDE, then SUICIDE \<password\>.
