These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.  

YELL sends a message to all awake players in the area.  

SHOUT, GOSSIP, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all  
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for GOSSIP.  The QUESTION and ANSWER  
commands both use the same 'question' channel.  

As your voice matures, your SHOUT will sound different.  

DREAM sends a message to all sleeping players.  

VENT is the message to use for when you feel the need to swear. You may use  
any language on this channel. Do not use foul language on any other channel!  

CLANTALK will send a message to all the players of your clan.  '[' and 'ct' are  
synonyms for CLANTALK.  

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
