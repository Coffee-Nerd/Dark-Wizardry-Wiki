# Alias

Syntax:  alias \<list|show|set|edit|remove|clear\> \<keyword\>  

 The alias system allows players to create shortcuts for commonly used  
 commands. Aliases can include multiple lines and support wildcards.  

 COMMANDS:  
 alias list     - Displays all saved aliases.  
 alias show \<keyword\>     - Shows the details of a specific alias.  
 alias set \<keyword\>      - Creates a new alias with the given keyword.  
 alias edit \<keyword\>     - Edits an existing alias.  
 alias remove \<keyword\>   - Deletes an alias.  
 alias clear              - Deletes all aliases.  

 USAGE:  
 alias set mm This will put you into the editor. Let's use  
 c 'magic missile' $* as our command, and hit @ to exit.  
 - Sets an alias mm to cast magic missile on a target.  
 - Use mm demon lord to cast c 'magic missile' demon lord.  

 Once an alias is set, you can use it by typing its keyword.  
 mm demon    -\> Expands to: 228 c 'magic missile' demon  

 WILDCARDS:  
 $ - $ - Replaces with the one single word from the input.  
 $$*      - Replaces with everything after the alias keyword.  

 EXAMPLES:  
 alias set heal, with the commands:  228c '$' $  
 - Typing "heal Bob minor" expands to: 228Y c 'Bob' minor  
 - Typing "heal self cure" expands to: 228 c 'self' cure  

 alias set ooc, with the commands: 228 gossip $*  
 - Typing "ooc Hello world" expands to: 228gossip Hello world  

 alias set superkill, with the commands: 228bs $;trip $;garotte $  
 - Typing "superkill demon!" expands to: 228bs demon;trip demon;garotte demon  

 NOTES:  
 - $$* captures multiple words as a single string.  
 - $, $, $, etc. capture individual words from input.  
 - Combining both allows flexible alias usage.
