# Vanir

The Vanir and the Aesir are two very similar races in appearance, and indeed they  
share the same lineage. At times they have been known to war, but the differences  
are easily put aside for the greater good. They come from physically intimidating  
stock, standing tall at around 10', and are famed as a very hardy race of immortals.  
The difference between them started many generations ago when some went with more  
intellectual pursuits and the other focusing on strength at arms. The Aesir are  
focused on melee combat and the Vanir are focused on magics. They are both naturally  
defensive.
