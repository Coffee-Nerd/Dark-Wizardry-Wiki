# Hirelings

You can buy hirelings at some places.  You may buy one more hireling each time  
you advance a level.  Your hireling-buying opportunities do not accumulate;  
use them or lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of hirelings.  

You can order hirelings to hunt down players or mobs in the same area, or use  
them to aid you in combat.
