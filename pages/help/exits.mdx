# Exits

Syntax: exits  
Syntax: scan  
Syntax: survey  

EXITS tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are  
visible.  You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk  
in a certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set,  
you will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.  

SCAN will show you all visible players and mobs in adjacent rooms.  

SURVEY will let you survey your surroundings, giving you extra information about  
the room you are in that you may otherwise not be able to determine.
