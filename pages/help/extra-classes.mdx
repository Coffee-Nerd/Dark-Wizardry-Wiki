# Extra-classes

Upon reaching level 40 in your primary class and 35 secondary, a special  
class might come available.  Each special class has only 5 levels.  

You can get these combinations in any order, as long as they are your primary  
and seconary classes, meaning if Warrior is your first class (PRIME), and  
Cleric is your second class (SECONDARY), you will be a Paladin. It does not  
need to be in the order shown below.  

Current Combinations (primary/secondary, in any order)

To get your first Extra Class you must level to 40 in your primary class,  
and level to 35 in your secondary class. You can acquire this first extra class  
at total 75 levels at the earliest. The second extra class becomes available  
at level 190, which is called LORD or LADY, but only if with balanced classes.  
I.E. your levels must be 40/40/40/35/35, where your main three classes are at  
40, and the other two are at 35.  

Your third extra class becomes available at HERO, which is level 200, and this  
happens when all of your classes are level 40 (40/40/40/40/40).  
If you are above remort 0, you can obtain a fourth extra class at AVATAR (230).  
This is the MAX level attainable by mortals, so your classes will be perfect,  
at 50/50/50/40/40 (in any order, of course).
