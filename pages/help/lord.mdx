# Lord

As you journey through Dark Wizardry, gaining levels and expertise, you  
will come to different points where your excellence is rewarded. The first  
of these is at level 40 primary, 35 secondary: at this point, you will  
gain one EXTRA CLASS (see help EXTRA-CLASSES). After this mark, as you  
continue your work, you will find two more goals to strive for.  

LORD/LADY: This is achieved when your levels are:  40  40  40  35  35.  
At this point, you can level in a second EXTRA CLASS, and the class  
portion of your god-title will change to LRD or LDY.  

HERO: The cream of the crop! When you reach level 40 in all five classes,  
you become a HERO and can choose a third EXTRA CLASS. Also, the class  
section of your god-title will change again to show the world your stunning  
achievement. Once you are a hero for the first time and have attained the maximum  
levels in your extra-classes, you have the option to remort.
