# Challenge

Syntax: challenge list  
Syntax: challenge \<player\>  
Syntax: challenge stake \<amount|object\>  
Syntax: challenge \<accept|reject|revoke\>  

You can CHALLENGE other heroes of the realm to a fight. Your stakes are set, and,  
when everything is decided, accept the challenge. You will then both be allowed to  
fight anywhere in the game. The winner takes all.  

Player on player damage is reduced by 10 times and there is absolutely no loss of equipment  
or experience on death as the result of a challenge.  

You can use CHALLENGE LIST to see any ongoing fights in the world.  

To initiate a challenge with another player, simply CHALLENGE \<playername\>.  

Each side will then have to set their stakes. You can bet objects or gold or both.  
To do this, enter CHALLENGE STAKE \<amount\> or CHALLENGE STAKE \<object\>, or both.  

Objects will not change ownership as result of a victory.  

Once you are happy with the stakes that you have set and the stakes your opponent  
has set, CHALLENGE ACCEPT will show your readiness for battle. When both of you have  
accepted the battle, you will both be flagged for battle and you may begin.  

If you have issued a challenge to someone else and have not accepted it, you can  
CHALLENGE REVOKE the challenge. If you have been challenged and are not interested,  
CHALLENGE REJECT will turn it down.  

Once the challenge is accepted by both sides there is no option to cancel it. If someone  
quits, the other person is declared victor.
