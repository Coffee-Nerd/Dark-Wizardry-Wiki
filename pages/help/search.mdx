# Search

Syntax: search \<doors | items | traps\>  
Syntax: disable \<object\>  

SEARCH will let you search for traps, secret doors or hidden items.  

SEARCH has a better chance of succeeding when one practices the high level  
thief skills: 'SEARCH ITEMS', 'SEARCH DOORS' and 'SEARCH TRAPS'.  

DISABLE will let you remove trap charges from a trapped object.  You don't  
have to practice the high level thief skill DISABLE TRAP in order to do a  
successfull DISABLE, but this is highly recommended though.
