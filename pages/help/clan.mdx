# Clan

Clans are groups of people that try to further a common idea. Players  
can apply to a clan at 50th level, using the clan command.  

If you want to set up a new clan, you have to speak with Verlic.  He might  
set you up one.  Of course he must be payed for his services.  You will then  
get a clan area, including a donation room ( store room ) and a recall room.  
For more info about starting clans, ask the gods...
