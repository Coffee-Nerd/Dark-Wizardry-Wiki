RESTRING allows you to customize your item's keywords, short description,  
 and long description for a fee in gold or tokens.  

To begin, type  "restring \<item\>"  for an item you are carrying, then  
 use these commands within the restring editor:  

 /name \<keywords\> - Sets new keywords for the item. Separate keywords  
 with spaces, e.g.,  "/name ancient magical sword". (Max 120 characters)  
 Cost:  3 million gold.  

 /short \<description\> - Sets a brief description for inventories or lists,  
 e.g.,  "/short a glowing magical sword". (Max 100 characters)  

 /long \<description\> - Sets a detailed description for full item views,  
 e.g.,  "/long A mystical sword with ancient runes engraved along the blade."  
 (Max 120 characters)  

Cost for either /short or /long (or both):  12 million gold.  

 /confirm gold - Confirms and charges gold.  
 /confirm token - Uses a Restring Token, covering all fees.  
 /show - Shows current restring details and estimated cost.  
 /cancel - Cancels restringing without saving changes.  

Note: Ensure descriptions meet length limits, and keywords are chosen to  
 represent the item well. Happy customizing!
