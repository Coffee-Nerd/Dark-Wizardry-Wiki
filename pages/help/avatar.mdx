# Avatar

There is nothing more advanced than an AVATAR. After you have remorted and regained  
your HERO status, you will find available a further 25 levels in three chosen classes.  

For your first remort, these are broken down into 10 levels in two basic classes  
(i.e. warrior, thief, mage, psionic and cleric), 5 in a third basic class, and 5  
extra-class levels in a fourth extra-class.  

Note that the road to becoming an Avatar is hard. Do not expect an easy ride  
because you have done it before. Your extreme levels of experience through  
your current and past lives makes it harder for you to gain any more. Once you  
are a hero, the experience you gain from creatures of a lower level than your  
own will be greatly diminished.
