# Brandish

Syntax: brandish                        - for a staff you are holding  
Syntax: quaff   \<potion\>                - for a potion in your inventory  
Syntax: recite  \<scroll\> \<target\>       - for a scroll in your inventory  
Syntax: zap     [target]                - for a wand in your inventory  

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed  
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the  
\<target\> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a  
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting  
someone, then that character is used for a target.  

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.  

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single  
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no  
more charges, it will be consumed.
