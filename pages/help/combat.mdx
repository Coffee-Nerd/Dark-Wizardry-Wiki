# Combat

Syntax: cast 'combat mind'  

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her  
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an  
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the  
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathic, this  
knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
