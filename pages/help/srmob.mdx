# Srmob

If one purchases the "Inventory Saving" option for their SR, the inventory  
of their sorting mob will be saved during a HotBoot.  This is mainly used  
for storing no-take items without the need for a "mule" character.  Be sure,  
when purchasing this option, to be sure to tell whomever is editing your room  
how you wish to interact with your mob to retrieve your items.  Note that you  
should 'not' give gold to this mob, as it may not be returned.
