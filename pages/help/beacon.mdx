# Beacon

Syntax: cast beacon  
Syntax: cast portal  

PORTAL will create a dimensional portal to a previously placed BEACON.  
This so called beacon can be created by casting beacon.  The beacon will be  
placed in the room and will disappear after a period of time or when a portal  
is created to the beacon.  Only one beacon per player can be placed somewhere  
in the world.
