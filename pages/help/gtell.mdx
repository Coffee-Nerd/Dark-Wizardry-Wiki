# Gtell

Syntax: gtell \<message\>  
Syntax: ;     \<message\>  
Syntax: say   \<message\>  
Syntax: '     \<message\>  
Syntax: tell  \<character\> \<message\>  
Syntax: reply \<message\>  

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to  
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are  
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no  
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).  

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')  
is a synonym for SAY.  

TELL sends a message to one specified player anywhere in the world.  

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work  
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This  
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
