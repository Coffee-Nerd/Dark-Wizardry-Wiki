# Calm

Syntax: cast calm  

This spell casts an aura of calmness over the group, making aggressive creatures  
non-aggressive to all members in the group. Members should stay as close as  
possible to the caster to stay within the aura. However, the creature's will to  
fight may be stronger than the power of the aura, so always beware!
