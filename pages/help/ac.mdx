# Ac

Your ARMOR CLASS is how well protected you are. Your armor class counts  
when a mob tries to attack you. It can either negate a hit altogether or  
reduce the damage taken.  

Certain equipment slots are more protective than others, as they cover more  
of your body, or cover more delicate locations of your body.  

The following chart shows some AC multipliers for the related wear locations.
