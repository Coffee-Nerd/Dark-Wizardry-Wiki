# Plant

Plants grow all over the world from the darkest dankest swamps to the greenest most fertile  
grassy plains. Many plants contain within them special and even magical properties which allow  
people with the skill to do so to use them to their benefits.  

There are several families of plants that grow throughout the world.  

  Pretty bluebells grow with alarming regularity.  

  Hogsworth and Hogsworp are closely related; the root and the leaf being of particicular interest,  
  respectively. Hogsworth is a well known poison and is fairly common. Hogsworp is rarer and less  
  is known.  

  Elderberries are a sharp fruit which grow in small amounts around the world.  

  It is also rumoured that a root called Mandrake can be found, but no one really knows where.  
  It is rumoured they have magical properties.  

  There are other plants to be found. Go find them.  

They say that some plants work very well applied as a poison to a weapon and others are better  
applied in a salve. Some plants will be very useful and others may have little or no affect.
