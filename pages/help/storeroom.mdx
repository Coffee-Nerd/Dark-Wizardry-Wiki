# Storeroom

Storerooms are another bonus item we offer players here at DW.  
Any player can purchase a room here for the amount of 30 million gold, or 25  
token of the Dark Wizards.  

What this room will do, is provide you a place to store up to 300 items without  
losing them on HotBoots.  If you exceed 300 items, the MUD will automatically  
start deleting items until it gets down to 300. If you would like a storeroom  
on DW, contact any Immortal and make sure you have the 30 million gold or 25  
token of the Dark Wizards ready.
