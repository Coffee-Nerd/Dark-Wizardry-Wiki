# Evil

Syntax: cast 'evil protection'  
Syntax: cast sanctuary  \<character\>  
Syntax: cast 'good protection'  

The EVIL PROTECTION spell reduces the damage taken from any attack by an evil  
creature by one quarter.  

The GOOD PROTECTION spell reduces the damage taken from any attack by a good  
creature by one quarter.  

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any attack  
by one half.  

Sanctuary may be used with either evil protection or good protection, but not  
both at the same time.
