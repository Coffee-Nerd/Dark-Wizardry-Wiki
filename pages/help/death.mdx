# Death

Syntax: cast 'death field'  

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists  
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The  
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the  
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly  
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,  
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different  
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor  
damage.
