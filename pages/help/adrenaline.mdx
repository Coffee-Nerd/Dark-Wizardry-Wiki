# Adrenaline

Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control'  

By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in his or her system,  
the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and constitution.  This  
control cannot be initiated during battle because, hey, even psionicists get a  
little excited from time to time.
