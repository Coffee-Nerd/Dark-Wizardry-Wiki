# Composition

Item Composition is useful for determining how certain items can be useful.  

Items that are composed of wood may be used to make fire, for example, or items  
that are composed of iron may be salvaged for scraps of iron, which may be used  
for crafting.  

Item composition was implemented LONG after most of the objects in existence  
were created, so if you find some objects to have an incorrect composition,  
please let us know and we will update the item.  

Most of the items in game have had their compositions procedurally assigned.
