  Werewolves are a mix of a human and a wolf, whose power comes out the best  
at night. Hearty, strong, and agile, Werewolves are able to handle themselves  
well in a fight, but give them a spell book and they make end up setting  
themselves on fire. Werewolves hate the day and as such find it impossible to  
regenerate; even their core attributes suffer. However at night their warrior  
side is enhanced and they can regenerate more quickly than many other races.
