# Train

Syntax: train \<'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'\>  

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your  
character has standard atttributes based on your class, and several  
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by  
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).  

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs  
only three practice to train your prime attribute.  

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more  
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.  
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train  
WIS and CON both to max before practising or training anything else.
