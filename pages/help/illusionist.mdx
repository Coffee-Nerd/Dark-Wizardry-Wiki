# Illusionist

Illusionists are a sort of Battle-mage who mix their powerful magics with their melee.  
As is the nature with people who mix disciplines they are not the best at either but  
the combination makes for a formiddable combination in an opponent. During your training  
as an Illusionist you will learn some spells which tap directly into your physical prowess  
and some which indeed aid it.  

Illusionists fight in hand to hand combat fairly well, but clearly not as well as their  
Samurai, Monk or Paladin bretherin. Many would say their magical powers make up for that  
fact.
