# Duergar

Sometimes called gray dwarves, these evil beings dwell in the underground.  
Most duergar are bald (even the females), and they dress in drab clothing  
that is designed to blend into stone. In their lairs they may wear jewelry,  
but it is always kept dull. They war with other dwarves, even allying with  
other underground creatures from time to time.
