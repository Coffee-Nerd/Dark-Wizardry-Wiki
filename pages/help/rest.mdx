# Rest

Syntax: rest  
Syntax: sleep  
Syntax: meditate  
Syntax: stand  
Syntax: wake  
Syntax: wake  \<character\>  

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you  
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.  
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,  
you won't hear many things happen.  

MEDITATE will allow you to concentrate soley on your mental powers.  
While medatating, you will regenerate your mana pool much faster,  
however will not regenerate hit points or movement.  

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can  
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
