220LEVELING GUIDE  
238This is by no means a full list of all low-level EXP places on the mud. This  
is just a small list to help new players get started. This list should carry  
through prime 40 and perhaps a bit beyond. It is listed in the order that  
players should attempt each area. Note that there are other places to level  
for many of the level ranges.  

Most of these zones can be reached via the CAVERNS. The caverns are a set of  
shortcuts which have been carved into the rock underneath Krynn. They are accessed  
east and down of the Djaron, in the temple of Krynn.  

You'll find equipment in pretty much every zone in the game, but to help you  
out a bit at the start, some of the better equipment zones have been highlighted  
below!
