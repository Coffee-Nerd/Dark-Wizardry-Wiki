# Harvest

Syntax: harvest \<weapon\> \<poison\>  

HARVEST allows the young cleric to carefully extract the potent sections of  
a given plant. Plants grow throughout the world in a number of varieties but cannot  
be used without HARVEST. This skill imbues in you the knowledge required to find  
the parts of the plant which have the properties you need.  

You will request some shears to use HARVEST. They are available for sale within the  
city limits of Krynn.
