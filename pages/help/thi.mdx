# Thi

The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school  
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey persons have  
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more  
agile.  Whereas a WARRIOR uses well placed weapon slashes, a THIEF seeks to  
DISARM his opponent.  THIEVES also excel in the art of stealth.  
An unwary opponent might not detect a THIEF until a BACKSTAB is attempted.  
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With  
a THIEF's PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skill, a THIEF also makes the perfect  
assassin for political powerhouses.  

The prime stat for Thief is: Dexterity
