KILL will engage you and your target in combat.  

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  

KICK will cause no-magic damage in combat  Damage is derived from your level.  
A Monk's KICK is far more powerful than an ordinary kick.  

SLASH will also cause no-magic damage in combat.  Damage is derived directly  
from your DR ( Damage Roll ).  Slash uses a slicing or a slashing weapon.  

GAROTTE will cause no-magic damage in combat, similar to slash.  Garotte uses  
a stabbing or a piercing weapon.  

WHIRL will cause no-magic damage to everyone in the room. You require a long  
blade to do this, as well as to have gone ever so slightly mad.  

CIRCLE allows an adept thief to circle around his victim and backstab them,  
mid combat. Clearly, a dagger is required.  

TRIP is also an auxiliary fighting command, to trip your opponent.  Tripped  
opponents will not be able to cast combat spells against you until they recover  
from you tripping them.  

NODISARM will make it harder for opponents to disarm you. The higher the skill  
is practiced, the higher your chance of successfully reflecting a disarm attempt.  

SWIFT, when affected by this skill, you can't be tripped.
