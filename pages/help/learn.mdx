# Learn

Syntax: learn  
Syntax: learn \<class\>  

LEARN without an argument tells you the experience needed for all classes,  
available for you.  

To actually level up, you need to go to a trainer like Lucan or one of the guilds  
you can find on HELP KRYNN. You then enter LEARN \<class\> to advance.  

I.e. if you want to level warrior, enter LEARN WAR. As long as you have enough  
experience, and you are at a trainer who can help you, you will progress in  
that level.
