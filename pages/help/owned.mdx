# Owned

OWNERSHIP of items has been added. This will not apply to all items - just some specially  
chosen ones. It will only affect new items. These items can be sold via auction to change  
ownership but there will be a minimum price. Ownership is established by being the first  
person to grab the item from the corpse or room. OWNED items cannot be worn by other people.  
OWNED items will not stay in your corpse on death (unless they are in a container).  

You can use the GIFT command to give an object to someone. This will change the ownership of  
the object. You can only do this once and it will prevent the object from being sellable via  
auction.
