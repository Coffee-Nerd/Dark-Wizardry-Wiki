# Olam

The Olam like to think of themselves as thinkers, and while they are not without  
any intelligence their true power lies with their inherently thick skin and strong  
constitution. To picture an Olam think of an Ogre and a Treant mashed into a single  
body - bark like skin, almost semi-organic in nature, but spritely for it. Very  
strong and with the ability to heal quickly, the Olam are a race not to be messed with.
