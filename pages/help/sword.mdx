# Sword

Samurai spend so much time doing katas with their swords that when they  
wield a sword-type weapon, their damage increases. Sword experts can also  
IMPALE alert characters when the need arises.  

Sword experts can also wield any weapon with a long blade (i.e. slashing  
and slicing weapons).  

Use of this skill is automatic once practiced.
