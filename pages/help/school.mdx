# School

---  
| Mud School was designed by Bozak and Solkar.                                 |  
|                                                                              |  
| The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the      |  
| game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.                  |  
|                                                                              |  
| Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their        |  
| initial levels and equipment.                                                |  
|                                                                              |  
| You may not leave Mud School untill level 5 or above, at level 5 you may say |  
| 'krynn' at Lucan to be let out of school.                                    |  
|                                                                              |  
| You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.    |  
|                                                                              |  
| You may train your attributes and make them better at the trainer, Lucan,    |  
| close to the entrance of mud school.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.                      |
