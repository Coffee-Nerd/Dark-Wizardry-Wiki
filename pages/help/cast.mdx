# Cast

Syntax: cast \<spell\> \<target\>  

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,  
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.  
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.  

The \<target\> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an  
appropriate default target, especially during combat.  

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.  
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.  

You can abbreviate both the word cast and the spell name. For instance, to cast  
bless, simple "c b" will cast it, as bless is the first first alphabetically of  
the spells beginning with "b".  

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.  
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the  
saving throw successfully.
