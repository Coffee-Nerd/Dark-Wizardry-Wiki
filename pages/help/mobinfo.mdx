# Mobinfo

---  
| Our Mobiles have been infused with the breath of a |  
| shy faeyrie to give them a slightly warmer nature. |  
| Perhaps you have noticed this already.  If not, do |  
| take a moment to ask a mobile to tea.  The code is |  
| written by J Murphy, N'Atas-Ha of ThePrincedom and |  
| based on a concept created on Worlds of Carnage by |  
| Aaron Buhr. questions/comments to murph@cs.cmu.edu |  
| A little rewriting of the code/DOC/INSTALL done by |  
| Kahn of MERC Industries and tested extensively on  |  
| Marble Mud.                                        |
