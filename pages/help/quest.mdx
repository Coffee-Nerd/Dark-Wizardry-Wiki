# Quest

When you finish a quest, instead of doing "QUEST COMPLETE" you can do "QUEST  
CONTINUE", and the quest master will immediately generate you a new quest. The next  
quest will be given to you, slightly harder than the previous, and points awarded  
at the end. When you have achieved a quest target you can "COMPLETE". If you can't  
complete, you can "GIVEUP". Either way you will get the points for the quests that  
you have completed, however if you finish with "COMPLETE" you'll get a bonus. If you  
finish with "GIVEUP" you'll get a punishment. The size of the bonus or punishment is  
dependant on the number of quests in the chain.
