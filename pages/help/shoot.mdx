# Shoot

Syntax: shoot \<direction\>  
Syntax: shoot \<direction\> \<target\>  

When you HOLD a bow and have arrows in your inventory or in a quiver, you  
are able to SHOOT your victims.  You can ONLY shoot at targets that are  
NOT in the same room as you.  Also...you can only aim at targets that  
are in a room NEXT to yours.  You can aim by giving the name of the target  
you want to shoot.  Aiming can fail of course, which results in hitting someone  
else or none at all.  An arrow can only be shot 3 rooms away.  Every character  
in one of these 3 rooms has the chance of being hit by the arrow.
