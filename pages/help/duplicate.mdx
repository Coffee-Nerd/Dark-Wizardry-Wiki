# Duplicate

Syntax: cast duplicate \<item\>  

This spell duplicates any item carried by you. It will not duplicate any  
magical enchantments, and will make the duplicate nodrop, so only the caster  
self can use the item.  There's however a chance you fail the duplication  
which will destroy the original.  Chance of success depends on the percentage  
of duplicate practiced.  

Due to magical powers not known by the sorcerer, duplicate will not work on  
every item.
