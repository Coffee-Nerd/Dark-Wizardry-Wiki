# Dragon

Syntax: cast 'dragon form' \<lightning|fire|acid|water|demonic\>  

The most powerful mages can fully transform themselves into powerful dragons.  
This opens up a world of new opportunity, depending on the type of dragon  
the mage chooses to become.  

You will not be able to morph into every dragon straight away. The requirements  
are:  

Unlocked During Remort 1:  

Acid:             1              The dragon of constitution  
Gas:              1              The dragon of dexterity  
Fire:             50             The dragon of strength  
Lightning:        100            The dragon of intelligence  
Water:            150            The dragon of wisdom  

Unlocked During Remort 2:  

Demonic:          1  

As a dragon, of course, you can also use a breath attack. Simply type  
BREATH during a fight to unleash the fury!
