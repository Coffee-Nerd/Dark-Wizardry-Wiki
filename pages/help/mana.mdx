# Mana

Syntax: mana  

Mana is the quantitative measure of your mental prowess. When you cast a spell,  
it will cost mana. If you are low on mana you can MEDITATE or SLEEP to  
regenerate.  

As a command, MANA tells you the mana cost for all the spells you practiced.  
You can check this anywhere.  When command is used at a guildmaster, it will  
show the mana cost for all the spells available to you.
