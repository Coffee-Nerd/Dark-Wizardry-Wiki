  Halflings are short and agile hardworking folk, but slightly  
  weaker than the average race due to their small size.  They  
  can be very sneaky and quick fingered though when the need  
  arrives.  Halflings have keen eyesight, often able to spot  
  hidden things easily.  They are naturally born thieves.
