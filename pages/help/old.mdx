# Old

The Player Killing system has been changed a lot over the past few years.  
We believe that of all the systems, the one we have now should work out the  
best for everyone.  

To become a registered PK, you will have to ask an immortal to set you PK.  
This makes you PK'able by ALL other registered PK's. You can tell if someone  
is a PK by the (Pk) flag on who, or with WHOIS.  

An EXTRA-CLASS won't give players a PK flag anymore. Players from the old  
system with a PK flag that want to have it removed, can ask an immortal to  
remove it.  PK-flags that are set by immortals are irreversible, so think  
twice before asking for a PK flag.
