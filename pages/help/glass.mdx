# Glass

---  
|  The Orb of the Ancients has been resting in the lands of the       |  
|  Immortals for eons. During an informal game of catch between said  |  
|  Immortals, the Orb was smashed. It is now raining down all over    |  
|  the world. Should all the pieces be collected, the Orb can be re-  |  
|  forged. Should you find enough slivers of glass, you may keep the  |  
|  Orb.                                                               |  
|                                                                     |  
|  It is anticipated that it will take the following amounts to       |  
|  recreate the orb in it's original glory:                           |  
|                                                                     |  
|                   5 Slivers    ---     1 Shard                        |  
|                  10 Shards     ---     1 Chunk                        |  
|                   5 Chunks     ---     1 Orb of the Ancients          |  
|                                                                     |  
|  Once you get all 5 chunks, you may pick either Melee or Magic and  |  
|  ask an immortal to reforge the orb.                                |
