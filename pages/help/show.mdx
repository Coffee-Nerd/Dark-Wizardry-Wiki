 You can use the following information categories:  
 name       - Your character's name.  
 age        - Your character's age and playtime.  
 sex        - Your character's gender.

 hp         - Your current and maximum hit points.  
 mana       - Your current and maximum mana points.  
 move       - Your current and maximum movement points.  
 gold       - The amount of gold you carry and have in the bank.  
 alignment  - Your character's alignment.  
 stats      - Your character's stats like strength, intelligence,  
              wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma.  
 height     - Your character's height.  
 weight     - Your character's weight.  
 carrying   - The items you're carrying and their weight.  
 save       - Your saving throw against spells.

 You can use multiple arguments with the SHOW command to display several  
 pieces of information at once. The BRAG command will announce each piece  
 of information separately.  
 Examples:  

 "show hp mana gold"  - Displays your current and maximum HP, mana, and  
 gold balance.  

 "brag stats"  - Announces your character's stats to everyone in the  
 game.
