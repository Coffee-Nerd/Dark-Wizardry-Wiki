# Shieldbash

Syntax: shield bash \<target\>  

With a well-timed maneuver, the warrior slams their shield into their foe,  
disrupting their movements and dealing a crushing blow. A properly executed  
shield bash can break through defenses and leave the target reeling.  

The strength of the bash depends on several factors: the warrior's raw power,  
combat skill, level, and the weight of their shield. A stronger, more  
experienced warrior will land more devastating blows. Additionally, those with  
battle-hardened experience (remort level) will find their bash even more  
effective.  

To perform a shield bash, you must be wielding a shield and have enough  
stamina to charge into your target. The maneuver requires some movement  
energy, making it harder to execute if you are exhausted. Warriors who initiate  
combat with a bash often find it more effective, as an unprepared foe is more  
likely to be caught off guard.  

A well-placed bash may briefly incapacitate the opponent, leaving them stunned  
and unable to act for a short time. However, some foes may be quick enough to  
avoid the attack entirely. Due to the sheer force required, shield bash  
cannot be used repeatedly without rest. The skill has a short cooldown before it  
can be executed again.  

Master the art of shield bashing, and your foes will learn to fear the  
thunderous impact of your shield.
