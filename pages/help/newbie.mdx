This is a short and easy newbie help to start you on your way.  The immortal  
staff has worked hard (and is continuing to) to make this experience fun  
yet challenging.  

Mudschool is the place to begin.  If you know nothing of this type of  
game, it will help immensely to read everything as you walk through.  

When you become hungry or thirsty, you can RECALL (or use / as a shortcut)  
and you will be brought back to the temple of mud school.  If you DRINK  
from the fountain there, your hunger will be gone, and you will no longer  
be thirsty.  

First thing you should do is read HELP LEARN - this explains how you  
will level. HELP HINTS is also a good one ;-)  

During this era, magic and technology reigned, which has created some  
ingenius items.  Some of these items work simply by TOUCH. If you see  
an object, you may want to touch it and see if anything happens, but  
be ready, ANYTHING could happen.
