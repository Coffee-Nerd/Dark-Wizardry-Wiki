# Exp-cap

To prevent players from getting too many exp from one kill, an exp-cap was  
implemented.  Whenever you get more exp from a kill than your exp-cap allows,  
the exp gets blocked and you only get the amount of the exp-cap.  The exp-cap  
is based on your total levels.  However, if you are in a GROUP with someone,  
the exp-cap will be slightly higher.  You need to be with AT LEAST one member  
in the same room to get the higher exp-cap.
