# Anatomy

Syntax: anatomy  

With an expert understanding of anatomy, the thief can strike at the most  
vulnerable organs of their enemies, maximizing damage. This skill also enables  
the thief to avoid critical hits by instinctively protecting their own vital  
areas during combat, reducing the damage they receive.  

Additionally, the thief gains knowledge of a deadly pressure point that, when  
struck precisely, can instantly kill an opponent.  

The benefits of anatomy are automatic once it is practiced, giving the thief  
a distinct edge in battle.
