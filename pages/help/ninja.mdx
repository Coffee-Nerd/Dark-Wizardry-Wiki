# Ninja

The Ninja is something of a cross between an Assassin, a Samurai and a Sorcerer. It could  
be said that they tread on the darker side of life and the practiced Ninja has learnt well  
how to fight with their weapons and how to fight with their minds. Powerful magics are  
unlocked to the Ninja and powerful melee to boot. Extremely aware and ready at all times, the  
Ninja is a formiddable foe.  

Ninja's make for good casters, particularly with the spells learnt in their specialisation,  
since, like Illusionist, the spells learnt while training as a Ninja feed directly from the  
physical prowess of the Ninja. They are also good melee fighters - although clearly one would  
not expect the Ninja to hit as hard or as often as the pure melee specialisations.
