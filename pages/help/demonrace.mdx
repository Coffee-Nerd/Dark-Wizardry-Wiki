# Demonrace

Demons are unholy beasts of the netherworld, sent up to our lands to cause  
chaos and grief. They take many forms, but the most common is a winged  
human-like form, usually including horns or a tail somewhere on the body.  
They do have a great experience of fighting the good order, and have learned  
how to protect themselves from their ways. At night, dark forces assist  
them, making them stronger in melee battles.
