# Retribution

A Paladin is a peaceful warrior, but when threatened they will often  
show their true power. Retribution is a skill that lets you do 1.5x  
damage when you are attacked by an aggressive mob.  

Note: This only works on mobs that are level 601 and below, as mobs  
above this level are not phased by your attempts at revenge.
