  The Alfar as a race of immortal elves. Very distant cousins of the Vanir and  
Aesir, they share in that powerful bloodline and that much is clear from no  
more than a glance. Standing tall, even for an elf, and always immaculately  
turned out, they exude grace and calm. Noticeable from the outset is the easy  
and speed with which they can move, careful and precise movements which would  
lend themselves so very well to the Assassin's creed.
