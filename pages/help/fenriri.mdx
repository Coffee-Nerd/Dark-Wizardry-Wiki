  The single most fearsome race of creature, the Fenriri are direct descendants of  
the immortal part-wolf-part-God Fenrir. These undead creatures are at their most  
powerful during the day, however it is abundantly clear that at any time this is  
not a race that you mess with. The Fenrir are the strongest race of any. They are  
far from stupid but do not compare favourably with the other immortal races. They  
are among the fastest of all races, perhaps only narrowly beaten by the Alfar. Do  
not mess with the Fenriri.
