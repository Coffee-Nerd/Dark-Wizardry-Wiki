# Upper

Upper lower triple is a simple dice game... you bet upper, lower or triple and  
the croupier rolls the dice. If you bet triple and the outcome is triple, you  
win 20 times the amount you bet! If you bet upper and the total dice is more  
or equal to 11 or if you bet lower and the total dice is less or equal to 10  
you win twice the amount you bet. In all other cases the croupier wins.
