# Recall

Syntax: recall  
Syntax: crecall  
Syntax: temple  

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to  
the Temple of Krynn.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.  

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),  
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a  
curse will not recall at all.  

CRECALL will recall you to your clan recall room.  

TEMPLE sets your recall room.  Of course this only works in rooms blessed  
by God.
