# Treant

Treants are humanoid tree beings, known to stand about 11 feet tall.  They  
have very thick skin, made of bark, which is said to be even stronger in the  
sunlight, and they are very hearty, strong, and intelligent.  Being made of  
wood does have it's drawbacks, Treants are rather slow, and not the most  
intelligent beings around. Due to their hardy bark-skin, they are more  
difficult to damage than other races.
