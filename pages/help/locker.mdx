# Locker

Syntax:  locker \<list|deposit|withdraw|show|checklocker|lockerstats\>  

The storage locker system allows you to store and retrieve items safely.  
Once you purchase a locker, you can deposit items from your inventory,  
withdraw them later, and even view detailed information on stored items.  

COMMANDS:  
 locker list [index]      - Displays all items in your locker. Adding "index"  
                            will number each item for easier reference.  

 locker deposit \<item\>    - Deposits a specified item from your inventory  
                            into your locker. Example:  locker deposit sword  
                            removes the sword from your inventory and stores it.  

 locker withdraw \<item|#\> - Withdraws an item by name or number if using  
                            the indexed list. Example:  locker withdraw 3  
                            or  locker withdraw shield .  

 locker show \<item|#\>     - Shows detailed information about an item stored  
                            in your locker. If the item is a container, its  
                            contents will also be displayed.  

NOTES:  
You must have purchased a storage locker to use these commands.  
The system tracks the total weight of stored items and enforces a weight  
limit based on your lockers capacity.  

THIS IS A NEW FEATURE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE HAVE BACKUPS, BUT WE ARE STILL TESTING...
