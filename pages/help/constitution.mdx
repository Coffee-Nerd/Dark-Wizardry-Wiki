# Constitution

Constitution controls the stamina of your character.  The higher your  
con, the more hitpoints (HP) you gain per level. Constitution also  
directly affects how much damage you take. A character with a costitution  
of 19 may take up to 20% more damage than a character with a constitution  
of 26.
