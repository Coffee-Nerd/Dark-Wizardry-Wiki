# Paladin

Paladins are the virtuous defenders of light. They are strong warriors imbued by  
their diety and during your training as a Paladin you will learn many ways with  
which warfare can be used to better serve Him or Her.  

Paladin's learn to fight as well as any other class in their regular melee.
