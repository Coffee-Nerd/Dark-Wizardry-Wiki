# Haste

Syntax: cast haste \<character|mob\>  
Syntax: cast slow \<character|mob\>  
Syntax: quicken  

HASTE will give the victim more multiple attacks.  

SLOW will make the victim fight worse in combat, and will even make the  
victim move around more slowly.  

QUICKEN allows those races who have a natural racial speed to re-haste having  
been slowed.
