# Intelligence

Intelligence is directly linked to the power of your offensive spells.  
The higher your intelligence, the more damage you will be able to do  
with spells.  

Intelligence also affects one's ability to learn and use skills, and  
the mana gain when a character levels.  

Higher intelligence means that fewer practices must be spent to learn  
skills.
