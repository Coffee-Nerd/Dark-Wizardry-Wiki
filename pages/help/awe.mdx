# Awe

Syntax: cast 'awe' \<target\>  

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or  
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy  
will be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to  
fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature  
after only a brief lull in the action.
