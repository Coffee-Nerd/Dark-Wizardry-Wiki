# Keep

Items can now be marked as KEEP by using the command keep \<object\>.  
You can also UNKEEP items by using unkeep \<item\> -force.  

Adding a keep flag to items should prevent them drop being dropped, sold, or  
otherwise lost in some way. Keep in mind, this does not make items OWNED, so if  
your item is not OWNED you can still lose your object. See help owned for more  
details about owned equipment.
