# Necromancer

Necromancer's walk on the dark side of life. If you choose to train in the dark arts of  
Necromancy you will learn how to suck the life force from the creatures you destroy with  
your powerful spells. You will learn to raise the dead and force them to do your will,  
and you will enjoy it very much.  

Necromancers are powerful spellcasters but are utterly useless with melee combat. If thief  
is your prime, you may make a decent life for yourself as a battlemage type player. If you  
are cleric prime, you stand no chance of using melee.
