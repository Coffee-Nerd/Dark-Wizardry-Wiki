# Prayer

Syntax: cast prayer  

This spell will allow you attain the maximum strength (for non-remort races) of  
25. It will also add +5 to all stats, including strength. Other stats will not  
exceed racial maximums.  

For remort races it will push your maximum attainable strength to whatever the  
highest strength for that remort level is.
