# Dryad

Dryads are small forest spirits, akin to faeries or pixies. They have hundreds  
of years of experience talking to and healing the forest, this makes them  
exceptional at healing other beings. In direct sunlight, Dryads seem to glow,  
all signs of weariness slowly lifting off their faces. Dryads are very intelligent  
and agile, but being small, they are not very strong or hearty. Dryads heal and  
regenerate mental power more quickly than many other races.
