# Ego

Syntax: cast 'ego whip' \<target\>  

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or  
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing  
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of  
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
