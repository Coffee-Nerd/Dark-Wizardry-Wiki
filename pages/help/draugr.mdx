# Draugr

The little understood Draugr are a race of undead ghost like creatures. In many  
ways these wretched creatures define death, dragging with them the stink of decay.  
They are a host for all disease and are almost unrecognisable for their ugly and  
swollen forms. But being undead has it's advantages and this is a creature of  
untold magical power. There is simply no race in any creed which compares to the  
magical prowess of this creature.
