# Wimpy

Syntax: wimpy  
Syntax: wimpy \<number\>  

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces  
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.  

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.  

Some monsters are wimpy.
