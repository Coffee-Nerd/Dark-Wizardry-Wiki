# Rules

---  
| Mortal Rules/Guidelines                                                                   |  
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------            |  
| To insure that the realm runs with a minimal amount of distress and anarchy,              |  
| we have a short list of rules that need to be abided by.                                  |  
| ******************************************************************************            |  
|  1. DO NOT use profane language on public channels, except vent. Sexual, racial or        |  
|     social slurs will result in temporarily silence as a first warning.                   |  
|     Second time will result in permanent silence.                                         |  
|  2. DO NOT harass other players. This includes verbal abuse and looting items from        |  
|     player corpses, storerooms etc. Continuous harassment will result in your             |  
|     banishment from DW all together.                                                      |  
|  3. DO NOT BOT - botting is defined as automatically exp'ing or casting spells while      |  
|     not at the keyboard. It is OK to have triggers etc. for use while at the keyboard,    |  
|     but not away from it. The exception is at recall, where you can do as you like.       |  
|  4. DO NOT summon or bring ANY mobiles to Krynn or to its immediate                       |  
|     surroundings. Only exception to this rule is zombies for corpse retrievals.           |  
|  5. DO NOT summon mobs out of their intended areas with the intent to leave               |  
|     them there. Summoning to kill a mob is good, but leaving a mob outside of             |  
|    its designated area is not.                                                            |  
|  6. DO NOT advertise other MUDs or non-DW related issues on public channels.              |  
|     This includes in your title or in public notes.                                       |  
|  7. DO NOT abuse any bugs. Please report them to an immortal as soon as you               |  
|     discover one. Withholding information on an exploit can get you banned.               |  
|  8. DO NOT give out your password to other players. It is illegal to share                |  
|     characters, and can result in deletion of both you and the other player's             |  
|     character(s).                                                                         |  
|  9. DO NOT kill a NON-PK in ANY way! Warnings will not be issued for this                 |  
|     offense and will result in the deletion of your character(s).                         |  
| 10. Immortal word is LAW, arguing with an immortal can result in various punishments      |  
|     depending on the extent and content of the argument.                                  |  
| 11. DO NOT cast your non-offensive spells on mobs.                                        |  
| 12. DO NOT barge into a zone someone else is killing in and start killing. Ask first, if  |  
|       they say no, leave. As a caveat on this, however, 90% of the time you should be     |  
|       happy to share the zone they are exping in. Use your common sense, please.          |  
| 13. DO NOT exceed 2 characters per IP address. Multi-play is limited to 2 characters.     |  
| ******************************************************************************            |  
| If something is not on this list, that does not mean it is automatically ok to            |  
| do. Use common sense while playing and if something can be construed as wrong,            |  
| then take it as wrong. Use your best judgement. Play Nice and Have Fun!                   |  
|                                                                                           |  
| We reserve the right to modify these guidelines at any point in time                      |  
| without any notice or to render them null and void.                                       |
