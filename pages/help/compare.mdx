# Compare

Syntax: compare \<object-1\> \<object-2\>  
Syntax: compare \<object\>  

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,  
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are  
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.  

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object  
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.  

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might  
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
