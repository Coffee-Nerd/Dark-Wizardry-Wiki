# Hide

Syntax: hide  

If you successfully HIDE, the other characters can't see you unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.  

You must remain still for HIDE to work successfully.  
If you move, the affects of HIDE will be canceled and you will be able to be seen again.  

VISABLE will also cancel your hiding making you visable again.
