# Samurai

The Samurai is a fearsome fighter and master of the Sword. If you choose to train in the  
art of Samurai you will spend every moment either in meditation or with a sword in your  
hand. During your training you will learn to wield the sword with precision like no other,  
and to unlock a great power from within, maximising your potential in melee combat.  

Samurai, along with Monk and Paladin, are all about their melee combat abilities. In this,  
they utterly excel.
