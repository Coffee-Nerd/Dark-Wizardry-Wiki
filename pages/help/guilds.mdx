# Guilds

There are 5 main classes in the game, and extra classes are available.  
       (Use help extra classes to see the list of extra classes.)  

Warrior, Thief, Mage, Psionicist, and Cleric, each with their own guilds.  
These guilds are places where you can train your stats, and learn new skills.  
You don't need to find them to level up, as you can now level up from anywhere.  

If you're using our custom client you can use the # command to speedwalk,  
i.e. #u5n2w2s(open e)es or if you are using a different client you can use the  
runto command, like this u5n2w2ses but you will need to open the door yourself,  
or have pass door enabled to pass through the guild door automatically by using  
the in-game runto command.  

Here are the directions to each guild in Krynn. There are other guild locations  
in the game, but these are the current main locations you'll be using in Krynn.  

Warrior    : 220#un4w2s(open e)2e  
Thief      : 220#u5n2w2s(open e)es  
Mage       : 220#u3se(open n)2n  
Psionicist : 220#u5ne(open s)se  
Cleric     : 220#un4e2s(open w)2w  

Warning: There may be some aggressive thieves in the area, do be careful.  
         Use Lucan in the MUD School if you need to ;-)
