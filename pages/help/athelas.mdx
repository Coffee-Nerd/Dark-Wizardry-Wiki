# Athelas

Syntax: cast athelas  

With this spell the adept cleric can request of nature it's great bounty.  
Unfortunately the spell has never really been perfected and when cast  
nature doesn't tend to take it so well. You'll find yourself with a fight  
on your hand should you attempt this spell, but the benefits are there  
for those who dare.  

Should you withstand natures ferocious wrath, the rare athelas herb will be  
made readily available.
