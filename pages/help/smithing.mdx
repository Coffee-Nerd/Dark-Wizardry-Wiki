A warrior of moderate experience can learn to create armor and weapons from  
mineral ore. Mineral ore can be found in various places around the world and  
will have varying magical properties - some minerals very powerful and others  
very weak. The better the material, the better the product.  

You will need to be in a blacksmiths in order to forge items from ore, or meld  
ores together.  

There are two commands available to the smith, FORGE and MELD. FORGE is used to  
create equipment from ore, and meld can be used to combine two separate ores into  
one. When you MELD two ores together, the properties of the two different ores  
are combined, averaging any magical properties and applicable levels. Often ore  
that you find won't be big enough to create anything meaningful from, so it is  
necessary to meld lots of ore together to get enough to make equipment. The ore  
will retain the description of the first ore when melding.
