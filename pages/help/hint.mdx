-                                  HINTS                                   -  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

These are some hints that may (or may not) help players new to this game,  
and or mudding in general.  

1) Use the help files :)  

2) If you find one lacking, report it, the immstaff will create one for it as  
   soon as possible. If you find a bug or have an idea, use IDEA report \<message\> and  
   BUG report \<message\>.  

3) Fly will cut down on loss of moves.  

4) Drinking from the fountain in the temple of Krynn will cure any hunger  
   pains you might have, as well as thirst. If there is a fountain in the room,  
   you need only DRINK.  

5) Be aware of how you are leveling; consider what extra-class you want to  
   end up as now, not after you've started leveling your secondary classes.  

   Review HELP EXTRA-CLASSES to consider which one you want. Each has their  
   own helpfile, and skillset which you can see with SLIST \<CLS\>, i.e. SLIST NEC, etc.  

   Level your prime class first - typically at least up to level 20 or 30  
   before persuing other classes. Don't level your other classes very much  
   until you get level 40 prime. It helps to get to your extra class as  
   quickly as possible.  

6) Equipment can be a certain level, or a total number of levels, it just  
   depends on how it was made. Check HELP NEWBIELEVEL to find equipment for your  
   level.  

7) Quests from Sabian are a great way to find new zones to exp in and to find  
   new equipment. Read HELP QUESTS for all the information on quests.  

8) TRAIN your stats as you go, the more wisdom you have, the more practices  
   you will get when you level.  The better your constitution, the more hit  
   points, and the better your intelligence, the faster you will learn skills  
   and spells (you will use less practices).  

9) PAGELENGTH will set the size of your screen so you can decide how much text  
   to display at once. Review the helpfile for more.  

10) You can set your PROMPT to show all sorts of different things and change  
    the colours - review HELP PROMPT to see how.
