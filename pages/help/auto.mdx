# Auto

Syntax: auto  
Syntax: config  
Syntax: config +\<option\>  
Syntax: config -\<option\>  

AUTO shows the status of some of your character behavior options.  

The CONFIG command configures some of your character behavior.  With no  
options, CONFIG shows you your current settings (identical to the AUTO  
command).  With a plus or minus sign and an option, CONFIG turns that  
option on or off.  

The options are:  

    AUTOASSIST You automatically assist group members when fighting.  
    AUTOEXIT   You automatically see exits.  
    AUTOGOLD   You automatically get gold from corpses.  
    AUTOLOOT   You automatically loot corpses.  
    AUTOSAC    You automatically sacrifice corpses.  
    BLANK      You have a blank line before your prompt.  
    BRIEF      You see brief descriptions only.  
    COLOR      You see everything in colors.  
    COMBINE    You see object lists in combined format.  
    PROMPT     You have a prompt.  
    TELNETGA   You receive a telnet GA sequence.  

You can also type just the name of the option you want to toggle,  
directly from the prompt. See the helps for these commands.
