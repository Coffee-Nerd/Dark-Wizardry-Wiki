# Multi-class

Dark Wizardry has a multi-class system.  This allows you to level in all  
of the five basic classes and get skills/spells available of any class.  

It is wise to progress in your prime class as much as possible. A good goal  
is to get to at least level 30 before leveling much in other classes.  

You will not level automatically. You can level by typing lev \<class\> i.e. level mage.  

There are also ten extra classes ( HELP EXTRA-CLASSES ) which will be available  
on higher levels.  

The requirement of experience will increase as you progress through the  
levels, as will your capacity to gain experience.
