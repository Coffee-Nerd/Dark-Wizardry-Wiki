# Pray

Syntax: pray  

You can retrieve your corpse by praying at Kala in the Temple of Krynn.  
The services of the Gods are free at first, but become expensive after a while.  
After your character reaches a certain level, Kala will no longer be able to  
convince the Gods to give her your corpse.
