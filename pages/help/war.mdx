# War

The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their  
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them  
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the art of  
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a SECOND ATTACK and if experienced  
enough, master a THIRD ATTACK.  Along with this training in multiple  
attacks, a WARRIOR is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED DAMAGE  
is available to only the learned.  Toward the defense side of the WARRIOR,  
skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow the WARRIOR to ward off attacks,  
rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
