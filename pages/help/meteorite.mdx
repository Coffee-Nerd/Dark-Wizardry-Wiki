# Meteorite

Syntax: cast 'meteorite' \<target\>  

This spell requires enormous power to pull off, but when successful will open a vortex  
over the area you are standing in which will expel a meteorite at your target. So  
powerful is the vortex that on occassion it can actually suck you or the victim up into  
it and spit you or them out onto the other side.  

PLEASE NOTE: The Ranger spell REMEMBER will not with in conjuction with meteorite.  
If you are sucked through the vortex you have no time to take baring - you will not be  
able to remember to a location if you are thrown to through meteorite's vortex.
