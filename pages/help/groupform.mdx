# Groupform

Syntax: groupform  
Syntax: groupform \<character\> \<row\> \<left|center|right\>  

GF is a synonym for GROUPFORM.  

GROUPFORM allows the leader to let the group walk in a formation.  This is  
only possible when the group consist of two or more members.  There is an  
unlimited amount of rows where the leader can put the members in.  Every row  
can have a max of 3 members.  The first row gets hit the most and has more  
chance of being attacked by an aggressive monster.  This row is basically for  
warriors.  The other rows get hit less, however...'safe' rows can be  
surprisingly attacked by monsters sneaking up from behind.  Still, these rows  
are best suited for magic users.  Of course, characters that are in front  
row hit harder.  The higher row you are in, the less damage you do.  

Characters that are, for some reason, not in same room as the leader will stay  
in the formation ( they appear red ).  If such a character is positioned in the  
first row, some characters from 2nd row will get more vulnerable to attacks from  
aggressive monsters.  Vulnerable members are marked by a '*'.
