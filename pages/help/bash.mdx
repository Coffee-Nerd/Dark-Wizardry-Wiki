# Bash

Syntax: bash \<direction\>  

A powerful warrior can attempt to bypass the intricacies of unlocking  
and opening doors by simply bashing through them.  This, of course,  
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.  
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly aggressive action, and  
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
