# Experience

Dark Wizardry is different to other MUDs and the first and most obvious  
place it differs is in the leveling system. Because Dark Wizardry is a  
truly multi-class system, leveling will not happen automatically.  

To see how much experience you require to level, type LEARN. If you  
haven't leveled before, it would make sense to review HELP LEARN.  

Once you can level, you need to find your trainer. If you are in MUD  
School, go find Lucan south of your recall point. If you are in Krynn,  
type HELP KRYNN to find the appropriate trainer for the class you  
want to level.  

Once you have located and got to the trainer, type LEARN \<class\> in  
order to level, i.e. if you want to progress in the warrior class, type  
LEARN WAR  

HINT: Remember to train up your wisdom first, to get the most practices!  

You gain experience by:  

    being part of a group that kills a monster  

You lose experience by:  

    fleeing from combat  
    recalling out of combat  
    being the target of certain spells  
    dying  

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players  
are in your group; the level of the monster; your alignment versus the  
monster's alignment and your level versus the monster its level.
