# Ballistic

Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' \<target\>  

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw  
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,  
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and  
painful to the victim.
