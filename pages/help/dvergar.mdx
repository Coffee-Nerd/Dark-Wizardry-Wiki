# Dvergar

Fiercely combatant and immortal make for a fearsome mix when it comes to these  
distant cousins of dwarves and of the Vanir and Aesir. Tall, for a creature with  
any dwarf in them, at about 6' the Dvergar are physically strong but it doesn't  
end there. Thanks to the immortal heritage, they are also capable magical casters.
