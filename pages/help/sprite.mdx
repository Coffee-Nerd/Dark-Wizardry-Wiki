# Sprite

Sprites are a group of the fairy folk, only about 1-2 feet tall.  
They naturally fly and have the ability to detect the invisible.  
They are probably the best magic users of all races, but due to  
their size are more challenged when it comes to physical combat.  
Sprites dislike poisons, but are somewhat resistant to magic.
