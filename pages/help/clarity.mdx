# Clarity

Syntax: clarity  

The practitioner of this skill, can call upon intense mental training,  
and the energies around him or her, to bring about a calm focus, greatly  
increasing their power and accuracy.  (The affects are opposite of suicidal  
attack, so the two cannot be combined, they cancel each other out.)
