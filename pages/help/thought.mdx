# Thought

Syntax: cast 'thought shield'  
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'  
Syntax: cast 'displacement'  
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'  
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'  

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.  

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place  
by the psionicist's will.  

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an  
armor-like substance.  

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other  
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.
