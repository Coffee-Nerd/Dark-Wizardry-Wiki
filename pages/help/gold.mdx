|                                                                                  |  
| GOLD is the main currency with-which the heroes of the realm use to trade.       |  
| Most creatures stock small amounts of gold and it is typical for heroes to loot  |  
| their quarry, however there are many other ways that gold can be made. Equipment |  
| garnered from unwitting enemies can be sold in shops all over the world for often|  
| great sums of money. Treasure is available in many areas which again can be sold.|  
|                                                                                  |  
| There is also a huge mine in which all players of all shapes and sizes can go    |  
| and try their luck at mining. Rare artifacts are known to be found in the mines, |  
| and Ewean, in the north-east of Krynn, will buy them for large amounts of gold.  |  
|                                                                                  |  
| The mines are located in the northern hills and you can buy a pickaxe at the     |  
| entrance or from Ewean. It is not possible to recall from this area so either    |  
| remember your way out or take a warpstone or word of recall scroll. It's fairly  |  
| typical to take a zombie to carry your finds, if you can animate the dead, and   |  
| mining is exhausting so the refresh spell is also very handy.                    |  
|                                                                                  |
