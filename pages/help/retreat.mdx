# Retreat

Syntax: retreat \<direction\>  

The RETREAT skill allows you to attempt to flee in a specific direction  
during combat. When you use this skill, you will attempt to move in the  
specified direction.  

The success of the retreat is based on your warrior level and strength,  
with a chance to fail. If successful, you and any followers in the same  
room will move to the chosen direction.  
The retreat attempt costs a certain amount of movement points.  

Using the retreat skill:  
  - Use the command 'retreat \<direction\>' where \<direction\> is north, east,  
    south, west, up, or down.  
  - If you have followers, they will attempt to retreat with you.
