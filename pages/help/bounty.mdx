# Bounty

What are bounties?  

Bounties are like community quests for helping the game to progress in ways  
that might be able to be handled by players, instead of only immortals.  
Bounties can include things like player-written help pages, art competitions,  
polls, ideas, color ideas, and much more.  

You can think of bounties as a way to earn token of the Dark Wizards,  
which are used for special things like secret shopkeepers or buying unique  
bonuses.  

You can check out those unique buyable bonuses via HELP TOKEN.  

If you have any further questions about bounties, you can ask Demon, but  
bounties can be found on our discord, at the following link, in the  
 # dark-wizardry-bounty-board subchannel.
