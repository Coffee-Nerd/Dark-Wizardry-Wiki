# Client

240We have our own custom client, which can be found here!  

https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/DarkMUSH/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  

Just download the client and unzip it to your desktop (or somewhere else read/write-able)  
Then open the folder, open MUSHclient.exe, and load it up.  

From there you go to the top left and do File-\>Open World-\> DarkMUSH.mcl  
and you should be set!  
Happy mudding!!
