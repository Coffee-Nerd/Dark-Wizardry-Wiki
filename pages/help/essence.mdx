# Essence

---  
|  The Dark Wizard himself has torn from his soul the very essence     |  
|  of Dark Wizardry and shared it out, hidden in five corners of the   |  
|  world with five of his most trusted collaborators. It will take     |  
|  the final remnant of the Essence of Dark Wizardry, surely protected |  
|  by the Dark Wizard himself, to bind the essences back together.     |
