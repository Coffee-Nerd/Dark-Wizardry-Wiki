# Monk

Monks are something of an enigma. They spend their youth in calm medititive practice of their  
mental attributes before their training as a Monk. Once they embark upon the journey that is  
becoming a Monk, they unlock a great power within. Monks are powerful melee fighters and pack  
a fearsome KICK (the warrior skill must be practiced). Their training allows them to do many  
things with just their hands that the most powerful fighters can only do with magical help. On  
top of that, they are powerful spellcasters - having good pedigree with a Cleric / Psionic mix.  

Monks spend their entire lives in training and will find their damage increases steadily onward  
throughout their lives. When they reach the peak of their power, they are arguably unmatched  
in melee combat. Not to mention their abilities with magic.
