# Note

Syntax:  

board [number|name]             Shows or changes board.  
note                            Reads next note.  
note + \<text\>                   Appends a line to the note  
note -                          Remove last line  
note (r)ead [number]            Reads a certain note.  
note (d)elete \<number\>          Deletes/removes a note written by you.  
note (l)ist [number]            Shows up to number notes.  
note (t)o \<recipients\>          Sets recipients  
note (s)ubject \<subject\>        Sets subject of note  
note (v)iew/show                Views/shows note currently in progress  
note (p)ost                     Posts the note  
note (c)lear                    Clears a note you are currently writing  

You can use '$$' as a synonym for note. So if you would like to post the note  
currently in progress, you can just type: $  

Instead of just one board, there are several, each with its special purpose.  

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD  
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of  
unread message. To change, type BOARD \<number\> or BOARD \<name of the board\>.  

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,  
type NOTE READ \<number\>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes  
shifts you to the next board.  

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing  
NOTE LIST \<number\> will list only \<number\> of the last notes in the area.  

You can remove your own note by using NOTE DELETE \<number\>. Implementors may  
delete other people's notes.   Purging happens automatically at bootup.  
Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.  

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". If you want to send  
a note to a clan, address it to the clan its name.
