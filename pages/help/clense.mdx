# Clense

Syntax: cast clense  

The caster calls upon his deity to bathe the surroundings with a holy light,  
clensing the souls of all creatures that are not good at heart.  
And yeah, we know it's supposed to be spelled cleanse, it's just always been  
like that and can't easily be fixed without changing every player file. :P
