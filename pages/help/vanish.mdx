# Vanish

Syntax: vanish  

A skilled thief possesses the ability to slip into the shadows even in the  
midst of battle, effectively vanishing from sight. When you successfully  
vanish, you become hidden, evading detection by others. Only those with the  
keen perception granted by detect hidden will have a chance of spotting you.  

To maintain your hidden state, you must remain perfectly still; any movement  
will break the illusion, revealing your presence once more. Additionally,  
using visible will intentionally end your concealment, making you visible  
again.
