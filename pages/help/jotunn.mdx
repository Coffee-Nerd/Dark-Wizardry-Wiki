  Towering immortal giants, the Jotunn have rightly earned a fierce reputation as  
  a race capable of devastation beyond the imagining of any other.  
  Born of nature herself, the Jotunn are imbued with her glorious and ferocious  
  wrath. They possess a supernatural strength unmatched except by the fearsome  
  Fenriri.
