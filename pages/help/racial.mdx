# Racial

At their highest level, God bestows upon the cleric a final gift. With piety all  
clerical protection spells are in some way enhanced. Normally this is only true  
for angelic (good aligned) clerics, but races with racial piety are bestowed this  
gift from their very birth.  

This is a passive skill and requires nothing to activate.
