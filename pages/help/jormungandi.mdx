# Jormungandi

The Jormungandi are the spawn of the serpent Jormungand. Like the Greek myths  
of Echidna, Jormungand's children take all sorts of different forms but are  
always formidable foes and worthy allies. You can guarantee that the Jormungandi  
will be the toughest of all the races with astounding statistics. Jormungandi  
are always born with the head of a serpent and the fangs to match.
