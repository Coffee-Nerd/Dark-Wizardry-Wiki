# Horrific

Syntax: cast 'horrific visage' \<target\>  

This spell summons an evil spirit from the very nightmares of the victim.  
As a result, the victim is grabbed and dragged into a dream state,  
where his body and everything being carried are destroyed.  

There are victims who have no nightmares, and therefore cannot be taken.
