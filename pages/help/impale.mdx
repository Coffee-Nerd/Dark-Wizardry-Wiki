# Impale

Syntax: impale \<character\>  

IMPALE is an extremely powerful starting attack, where the warrior can literally  
impale his/her foe, running them through with a sword.  

This attack requires a sword and completely exhausts the warrior for a considerable  
period of time.  

IP is a synonym for IMPALE.
