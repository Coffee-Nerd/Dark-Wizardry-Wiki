# Heygan

The Heygan are a race of ultra-intelligent creatures. Usually swathed in the  
dark fabrics of wizard's robes, the Heygan's true appearance is largeley unknown.  
They rarely come out from their vast libraries and are very often underestimated,  
which often ends very badly for the person underestimating. The Heygan are a  
peaceful race and as such masters of the defensive arts. They enjoy a constant  
reduction in damage due to their ever present magical aura. They also regain  
mana at an accelerated rate and resist magic well.
