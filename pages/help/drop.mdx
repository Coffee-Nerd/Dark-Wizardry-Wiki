DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.  

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even  
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.  

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.  

PUT puts an object into a container.  

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,  
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third  
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt  
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could  
type "drop all.pie". You can also DROP, GET or PUT a number of items.  
For example, by typing GET 5 sword, you will get 5 swords (if there are  
5 or more).  

TOUCH makes you touch a certain object or character. This might result in  
an object to change form or even come to life.  

TOUCH will also TAG a player when you are in a TAG game.  These games are  
organized by the immortal staff.
