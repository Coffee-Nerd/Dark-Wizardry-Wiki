# Scribe

Syntax: scribe \<spell\>  

A powerful and well learned mage may actually bind a spell to paper, for later  
use. To do this they will require three components - ink and parchment, which  
are readily available, but they will also require special quills to channel  
their power through. Many casters around the realm hold these, but you'll  
have to kill them to find out who!
