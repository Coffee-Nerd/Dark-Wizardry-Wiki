# Detonate

Syntax: cast 'detonate' \<target\>  

With this skill, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the latent  
energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to  
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most  
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to  
be SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.
