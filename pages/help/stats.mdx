# Stats

Your statistics are what defines the strengths and weaknesses of your  
character. Each statistic controls an aspect of your character. There  
are five main statistics:  

  Strength       -    your base dam-roll, how much you can carry  
  Intelligence   -    the power of your offensive spells, how quickly you learn, mana gain  
  Wisdom         -    how many practices you get per level, mana gain per level  
  Dexterity      -    your base hitroll and armor class  
  Constitution   -    how much damage you take, how many hit points you get per level  

Statistics are very important and it will make your life much easier  
if you keep them at their maximums - i.e. the value you score should  
match the value in "HELP \<race\>"!
