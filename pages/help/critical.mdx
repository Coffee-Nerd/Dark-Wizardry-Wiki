# Critical

With CRITICAL HIT or POWER AURA practiced, you have the chance to deliver a  
devastating blow to your victim, killing it.  For CRITICAL HIT to succeed you  
have to wield a holy weapon.  POWER AURA will ONLY work if you wield NO  
weapon. RACIAL SLAY gives another chance for a critical hit.
