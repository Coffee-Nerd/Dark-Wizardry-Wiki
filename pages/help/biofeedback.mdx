# Biofeedback

Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'  

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood  
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce  
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing  
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
