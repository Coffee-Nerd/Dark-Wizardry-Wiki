# Build

We are constantly adding new areas to Dark Wizardry to make this a more  
exciting and challenging MUD. If you are a creative player with some  
playing time under your belt and ideas for new areas, you can speak to  
a DM about getting an ARCHITECT. As an ARCHITECT, you will gain access  
to our building port, where you can learn our building system and then  
write your area(s). In order to have your area added to Dark  
Wizardry, please observe the following conditions:  

1) Your area must have a medieval or pre-medieval theme.  

2) BE CREATIVE! Your area must consist of unique rooms and mobs. By this  
we mean that you should not use the same room descriptions over and over  
again; nor should your area be populated by one or two mobs copied over  
and over again. There are instances where copying a single room a *few*  
times is appropriate; mazes are one example. See an immortal with any  
questions you may have on this.  

3) Pay attention to detail! All mobs must have descriptions, as must all  
doors and exits. Details like these make your area unique and interesting.  
If you do not have the time or patience to do your area well, we will not  
have a place for it here on Dark Wizardry.  

The immortal staff will be happy to answer any questions you may have  
about becoming an ARCHITECT and building for Dark Wizardry. The immortal  
staff will help as much as possible to that you can successfully build for  
the most awesome MUD on the net! Please let us know if you are interested! :)
