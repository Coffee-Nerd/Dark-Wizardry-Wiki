HERBLORE allows you to do some more interesting things with plants.  

PREPARE extracts the best of the plant, concentrating it's efficacy. The overall  
"performance" of the plant will be better once it has been prepared by an adept cleric.  
In order to mix plants, they must first be prepared.  

MIX will allow you to mix the properties of several plants. You can mix any number of  
plants with the best affects achieved from mixing a number of different ones together.  
If you get it right, the plants can be combined to take all the best attributes of each.  

SALVE will allow you to create a salve from plants. You will need some water and a jar  
to make salve. You can make salve from any kind of plant but not all plants will have any  
real affect, and, of course, some salves may have negative affects. You can make salves from  
mixed plant pastes and you will need to prepare plants before you can create salves.  

You can name salves anything you like. When you make the salve you give it a name, for  
instance, if you are making a salve for out of elderberries you may call it "elderberry" -  
inwhich case you would say "salve plant elderberry". Alternatively you may discover  
that a plant has healing properties, inwhich case you may want to call it a healing salve -  
so "salve plant healing".  

APPLY will allow you to apply a salve to yourself. You can optionally apply it to you  
hands but unless you are a monk or a beholder it may do more harm than good.  

You will require a mortar and pestle to use MIX, and a jar to put SALVE into. All  
of which are available for sale within the city limits of Krynn.
