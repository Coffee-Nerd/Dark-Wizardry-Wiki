# Assassin

Assassins are the true extensions of the thief class, taking it and making it  
better. The skills learned in the Assassin's guild are specifically designed to  
enhance your skills as a surprise killer. You will learn better techniques in  
cold blooded murder, in defense and in avoiding the abushes of others.  

An assassin's strength is in their surprise attacks and in their ability to avoid  
danger when necessary. They're standard melee is clearly better than that of caster  
classes but not as powerful as many of the other fighters.
