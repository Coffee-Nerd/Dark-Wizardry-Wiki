# Acid

Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      \<victim\>  
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      \<victim\>  
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     \<victim\>  
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning  
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room. Each type of breath  
is more appropriate for different kind of dragons; fire dragons tend to rely  
on damage, whereas lightning dragons focus on magical power, and so on.  

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
