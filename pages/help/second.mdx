# Second

Syntax: Second Wind  

A warrior can tap into their deep reserves of endurance to gain a second wind.  
This skill allows the warrior to instantly restore their movement points to  
full, reinvigorating their ability to maneuver and press the attack.  

Second wind is an essential tool for maintaining combat effectiveness,  
especially during prolonged fights. However, it is not without its limits.  
The skill has a cooldown period during which the warrior must pace themselves  
before they can call upon this burst of energy again.
