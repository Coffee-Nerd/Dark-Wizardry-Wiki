# Druid

Druids are the Sorcerer's peaceful companion. A powerful magic user who has spent time  
on the defensive arts as well as the offensive arts, this specialisation will train you  
in advanced magics which will allow you to cheat the consequences of death, walk among  
aggressive mobs with impunity and more. Offense is not completely forgotten and the Druid  
discipline teaches offensive spells as well, although you should not expect to match the  
mighty Sorcerer.  

Druid's are completely useless in melee combat.
