# Jab

Syntax: jab \<target\>  

Congratulations, youve mastered the art of the jab! As a thief, youve learned  
that sometimes the quickest way to get ahead is by punching someone in the face.  

While jab might not deal massive damage, its a handy skill for those moments  
when you need a quick, sneaky strike. For those with a bit more finesse like  
monks or assassins the jab is a bit more effective, but for now, just enjoy  
the satisfaction of landing a punch with precision.  

Every great thief starts with the basics, so keep practicing and youll be  
jabbing your way to success in no time!  

P.S. Monks and Assassins are more adept at jabbing than others, so will notice  
their jabs doing a lot more damage than others.
