# Enhance

Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' \<object\>  

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects,  
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to  
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot  
rearrange its molecules.
