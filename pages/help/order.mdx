# Order

Syntax: order \<target\> command  

ORDER orders one of your charmed followers to perform any command.  
The command may have arguments.  You are responsible for the actions  
of your followers, and others who attack your followers will incur the  
same penalty as if they attacked you directly.  

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).  

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and  
they will no longer follow your orders.
