# Whirl

Syntax: whirl  

A warrior skill, used to swing your weapon around violently in a whirlwind  
style attack. This skill is meant to be used to hit ALL of the enemies in the  
room. If you are berserk, you will be able to land more hits in your raging  
fury. Achieving more remorts will also increase your ability to land more hits  
on an enemy, after honing your skill as a warrior over the course of time.  

This skill is quite complex, taking a lot of different skill to pull off safely  
and effectively, so its users will benefit more from having a higher warrior  
level, strength, dexterity, fifth attack, sixth attack, haste, berserk, and  
more remorts.  

This skill uses a lot of energy, so it is quite costly to your movement.  
Use strategically. If you are exhausted you will be unable to retreat.
