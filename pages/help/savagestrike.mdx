# Savage_strike

Syntax: savage \<target\>  

Unleashing the primal fury within, the warrior channels their raw strength into  
a devastating strike against their foe. This brutal attack, known as savage  
strike, is not for the faint of heart. With a weapon gripped tightly in hand,  
the warrior must summon every ounce of their power and precision, making each  
blow count.  

The effectiveness of this ferocious strike is amplified by the warrior's sheer  
physical might, their mastery in battle, and the experience gained from  
countless victories (remort level). Additionally, there is a small chance that  
savage strike will cripple your opponent, severely weakening them by negatively  
impacting their armor class, damage roll, hit roll, dexterity, and strength.  

However, such a powerful assault demands not only a weapon but also the stamina  
to execute it, as the warrior must have sufficient movement points to channel  
their energy into the attack.  

Mastery of savage strike can turn the tide of battle, leaving foes in awe...  
or in pieces.
