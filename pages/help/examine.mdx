# Examine

Syntax: look  
Syntax: look    \<object\>  
Syntax: look    \<target\>  
Syntax: look    \<direction\>  
Syntax: look    \<keyword\>  
Syntax: look in \<container\>  
Syntax: look in \<corpse\>  
Syntax: examine \<container\>  
Syntax: examine \<corpse\>  
Syntax: read    \<keyword\>  

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will  
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.  

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.  

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to  
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
