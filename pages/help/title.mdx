# Title

Syntax: title \<string\>  
Syntax: grouptitle \<string\>  

Sets your title/grouptitle to a given string.  

The game supplies a TITLE when your character is created and when you  
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.  
Once you set your title, it will not change when you level.  

You can also set a grouptitle for when you are grouped.  The title set by  
the leader will be used for the group.  

Please keep in mind, do NOT curse nor use offensive language in your title.  

You can also set colors in your titles:  
        $ $ : red / light red  
        $ $ : green / light green  
        $ $ : yellow / light yellow  
        $ $ : blue / light blue  
        $ $ : magenta / light magenta  
        $ $ : cyan / light cyan  
        $ $ : grey / white  
        $ $ : NO color
