# Share

Syntax: cast 'share strength' \<character\>  

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.  
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is  
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist  
does not become too weak.
