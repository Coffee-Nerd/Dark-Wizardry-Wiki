# DarkMUSH ASCII Mapper Documentation

This plugin displays an ASCII map in a dedicated mini-window. It captures map data sent by the game server and renders it with colors and formatting.

## Features

* Displays ASCII maps in a resizable mini-window.
* Supports colors and text formatting (bold).
* Customizable font face and size.
* Option to toggle the map data's visibility in the main output window.

## Commands

| Command              | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `set ascii font`     | Opens a font selection dialog to change the map's font.           |
| `ascii help`         | Displays a help message (currently a placeholder).               |
| `ascii toggle output`| Toggles whether the raw map data is shown in the main output window.|



## Usage

The plugin works by capturing map data enclosed between special markers: `{map_start}` and `{map_end}`.  Anything sent between these markers is treated as map data. Each line of the map data is captured and displayed in the mini-window.

The plugin handles colors and bold formatting based on the styles sent by the game server.

## Configuration

* **Font:** Use the `set ascii font` command to choose the font face and size for the map display. The mini-window automatically resizes to fit the chosen font.  The recommended font is *Fira Code*.
* **Output Toggling:** The `ascii toggle output` command controls whether the raw ASCII map data (between `{map_start}` and `{map_end}`) is displayed in the main Mudlet output window. This can be useful for debugging or if you prefer to see the raw data.

##  Example Map Data

The game server should send map data in the following format:


\{map_start\}  
.......  
..#...#..  
.......  
\{map_end\}



Where:

* `{map_start}` and `{map_end}` mark the beginning and end of the map data.
* `.` represents an empty space.
* `#` represents a wall or obstacle.

The server can include ANSI color codes and other formatting within the map data. The plugin will interpret these codes and display the map accordingly.


## Troubleshooting

* **Map Not Displaying:** Ensure the server is sending the map data correctly, including the `{map_start}` and `{map_end}` markers. Check the Mudlet console for any error messages.
* **Incorrect Formatting:** Verify that the ANSI color codes and other formatting in the map data are valid.
* **Font Issues:** If the map characters are not displaying correctly, try changing the font using the `set ascii font` command. The recommended font is *Fixedsys Excelsior* or *Fira Code*, which support many extended ASCII characters often used in maps. *Remember to download and install the font on your operating system*.

I recommend using Fixedsys Excelsior, found here
