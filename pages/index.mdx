# Welcome to Dark Wizardry Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Dark Wizardry**—an awesome medieval-style MUD that offers a rich gaming experience with multi-classing, optional player killing, clans, remorting, and tons of custom content.

Dark Wizardry is a true multi-class MUD, allowing you to level in all five main classes—**Warrior, Thief, Mage, Psionic, and Cleric**—simultaneously. As you progress through the game, you also have the opportunity to specialize in extra-classes such as the backstabbing **Assassin**, undead-conjuring **Necromancer**, peaceful earth-loving **Druid**, and many more. This multi-classing system lets you tailor your character to your unique play style.

## Explore a Vast, Custom World

- **100+ Custom Areas:** Say goodbye to generic stock zones. Explore an enormous world filled with custom-made zones, intriguing quests, and hidden treasures.
- **Remorting & Races:** Remort as one of 45 unique races (with more on the way) to unlock additional character levels, new areas, and specialized equipment.
- **Engaging Quests:** Enjoy both automatically generated and meticulously designed quests that ensure long-term playability.
- **Clan Building:** Create and lead your own clan, attract members, and even wage friendly wars—though these days we tend to keep things peaceful.

## Modern Features & Custom Tools

Dark Wizardry also comes loaded with modern integrations:
- **Fun-Programs:** Random features that can multiply your experience gains or boost your damage output.
- **Holiday Events:** Special in-game zones for X-mas, Easter, and more to keep the festivities rolling year-round.
- **Discord Integration:** Chat with your fellow adventurers off-game and even receive in-game messages from your Discord chats.
- **Custom Graphical Client:** Experience the game through our beautifully designed custom MUSHclient. [Download the client here](https://github.com/Coffee-Nerd/DarkMUSH/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
